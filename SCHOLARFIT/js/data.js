The Colosseum stood silently, its massive structure a testament to human ingenuity and, perhaps, to human cruelty. As twilight approached, the old stones seemed to whisper stories of gladiators and emperors, of triumph and defeat. Modern tourists, armed with cameras and guidebooks, wandered through these historical grounds, their voices a stark contrast to the echoes of ancient times. Yet somehow, in the golden light of dusk, past and present seemed to merge, creating a timeless moment where history felt tangibly close.",

This is obtained by using the FOIL method or distributive property to multiply the two binomials: (2x)(3x) + (2x)(-2y) + (3y)(3x) + (3y)(-2y) = 6x² - 4xy + 9xy - 6y² = 6x² + 5xy - 6y².","question":"Simplify: (2x + 3y)(3x - 2y)","question_id":1,"user_answer_id":1}]},{"passage":null,"questions":[{"answers":[{"answer_id":5,"is_correct":false,"text":"10"},{"answer_id":6,"is_correct":false,"text":"25"},{"answer_id":7,"is_correct":true,"text":"32"},{"answer_id":8,"is_correct":false,"text":"64"}],"explanation":"The correct answer is 32. In the equation log₂x = 5, we need to find x such that 2⁵ = x. 2⁵ = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 32.","question":"If log₂x = 5, what is the value of x?","question_id":2,"user_answer_id":null}]},{"passage":null,"questions":[{"answers":[{"answer_id":9,"is_correct":true,"text":"6x - 2"},{"answer_id":10,"is_correct":false,"text":"3x² - 2"},{"answer_id":11,"is_correct":false,"text":"6x + 2"},{"answer_id":12,"is_correct":false,"text":"3x - 2"}],"explanation":"The correct answer is 6x - 2. To find the derivative, we apply the power rule to each term: for 3x², the derivative is 3 × 2x = 6x; for -2x, the derivative is -2; and the constant 5 becomes 0. Therefore, f'(x) = 6x - 2.","question":"Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x² - 2x + 5","question_id":3,"user_answer_id":null}]},{"passage":null,"questions":[{"answers":[{"answer_id":13,"is_correct":false,"text":"24"},{"answer_id":14,"is_correct":true,"text":"48"},{"answer_id":15,"is_correct":false,"text":"64"},{"answer_id":16,"is_correct":false,"text":"96"}],"explanation":"The correct answer is 48. In a geometric sequence with first term a and common ratio r, the nth term is given by ar^(n-1). Here, a = 3, r = 2, and we want the 5th term. So, the 5th term = 3 × 2⁴ = 3 × 16 = 48.","question":"In a geometric sequence, the first term is 3 and the common ratio is 2.

We can use the Pythagorean identity sin² θ + cos² θ = 1. We know sin θ = 3/5, so (3/5)² + cos² θ = 1. Solving this, we get cos² θ = 1 - 9/25 = 16/25.
